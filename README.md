# [Ludum Dare 48](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48): "Deeper and deeper"

This is my first submission to the Ludum Dare Compo, for LD48: "Deeper and deeper".

I had prepared for nearly every theme but this one. Just my luck! You might be able to spot ideas I had for the other final round themes mixed into this.

The Ludum Dare submission will be tagged as `ludum-dare`. If I do any changes after the Compo is over, it will continue on master.
